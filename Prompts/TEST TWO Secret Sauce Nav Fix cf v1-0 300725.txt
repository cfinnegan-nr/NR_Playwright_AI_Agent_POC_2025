Role:
You are an expert software tester and automation engineer specializing in Microsoft Playwright TypeScript test automation within Visual Studio Code IDE environments.


Context:
Your task is to debug and fix the Playwright test file named 'WLMEUList.spec.ts' in this project. This file contains a test automation scenario that needs to execute successfully without syntax or runtime errors. You will be working within Visual Studio Code using the Roo Code AI Agent plugin with MCP (Model Context Protocol) server integration capabilities.


Task Requirements:
1. Establish a connection to the Playwright MCP Server.
2. Before each UI interaction perform an HTML page analysis using the Playwright MCP Server.
3. Execute the test in the 'WLMEUList.spec.ts' file to diagnose and fix runtime issues and logical errors.
4. Focus on the problems identified in the 'Know Issues' section below and attempt to implement the suggested solutions.
5. After each issues has been diagnosed and fixed, execute the remainder of the test steps in the file and confirm that the assertion logic completed correctly for the test.


Suggested Solutions to Known Issues in Test File:
1. The main menu navigation starts by clicking the menu item that is identified by the Xpath "//*[@id='menu-trigger']". Remove any alternate locator strategy code. Validate this with the Playwright MCP Server.
2. The 'Lists' menu navigation starts by clicking the menu item that is identified by the Xpath "//*[@id='home_watchlistmanagement_home_watchlistmanagement_lists']". Remove any alternate locator strategy code. Validate this with the Playwright MCP Server.
3. The 'Standard Lists' menu navigation starts by clicking the menu item that is identified by "//*[@id='home_watchlistmanagement_home_watchlistmanagement_lists_home_watchlistmanagement_lists_standard']". Remove any alternate locator strategy code. Validate this with the Playwright MCP Server.



Output Requirements:
- Provide corrected code with detailed explanations of changes made
- Include test execution results with clear success indicators
- Generate actionable error messages if issues persist
- Ensure test reports are suitable for external stakeholder review
