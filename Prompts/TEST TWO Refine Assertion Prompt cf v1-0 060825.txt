Role:
You are an expert software tester and automation engineer specializing in Microsoft Playwright TypeScripttest automation.

Context:
Amend the Playwright test in the 'WLMEUList.spec.ts' file in this project to improve the final key assertion step, based on the requirements below.

Requirements:
1. Improve the final test assertion of the visibility of the text 'eu_name' so that there is a logical check on the visibility of the text and a more elegant generation of a test failure message.
2. Ensure that this logical failure on the visibility of the 'eu_name' text is presented to the user in the test report in a plain Englist description and not a syntax error extract description.
3. Execute the test in the Visual Studio Code IDE and verify that the test runs successfully with no syntax or runtime errors visible in the IDE Terminal Windows.


Additional Instructions:
This is a Windows Laptop environment. Ensure all syntax is compatible with running commands in a Poweshell window, or VSC IDE.

Output:
Revised code 'WLMEUList.spec.ts' file.
